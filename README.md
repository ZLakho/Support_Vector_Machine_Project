# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunication company by leveraging machine learning techniques. Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers ceasing their relationship with a company, is a critical concern for businesses, as it directly impacts revenue and profitability. By accurately identifying customers at risk of churn, proactive measures can be taken to retain them and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
The telecommunication company has provided historical data on customer behavior, including attributes such as age, monthly charge, and churn status (whether the customer churned or not). The goal is to develop a predictive model that can effectively classify customers into churn and non-churn categories based on these attributes. This model will enable the company to identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.

## Solution Approach
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed for this classification task. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm that excels in both linear and non-linear classification tasks. In this project, we utilize SVM with a linear kernel due to its simplicity and efficiency.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical customer data provided by the telecommunication company.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and categorical variables if any.
3. **Model Training:** Split the data into training and testing sets. Train an SVM model on the training data using a linear kernel.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Real-time Prediction:** Implement functionality to make real-time predictions on new customer data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
